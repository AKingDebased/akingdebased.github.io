## who? me?

hey there! i'm gabriel, a front end web developer living in los angeles, california. i'd like you to know that this site is the only place i ever lead with that bit of info, but since we're already talking about it, i love working with javascript (especially in node), though i'm no stranger to client side logic. i've also been known to fraternize with HTML & CSS, and i've developed single page apps and server side, database logic. i'm comfortable working on static sites, dynamic sites, APIs, databases, and all things in between (and beyond). i've worked with [beachcoders](https://beachcoders.com), [hackreactor](https://www.hackreactor.com), [glo](https://www.glo.com), and [recharge](https://rechargepayments.com/). i am  very comfortable in fully distributed, remote teams, but i've also worked with in-office teams (i'm a hoot to chat to at the old water cooler).

* here's my [résumé](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N39zsPEzhQh3N3zMEe52Fpbu8aMciZxZnSkjNc9kvk8/edit?usp=sharing).
* here's my[github](https://github.com/AKingDebased) (though his coolest work is all in private repositories. you're better off reading his [posts](/)).
* here's my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-gonzalvez-927b51ab/), if you want to see the nice things coworkers have said about him

when trying to impress people at parties, i prefer to talk about my [amateur 3d modeling](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheFaithlessForge), my growing stable of 3d printers, my deep obsession with [cosplay](https://www.instagram.com/faithlessfew/), weightlifting, magic: the gathering, and my ongoing quest to find a way to (legally) fight with a sword in my hand, boots on my feet, and a roar in my throat.

you can (and should!) reach out to me at [akingdebased@gmail.com](mailto:akingdebased@gmail.com)
