## who? me?

gabriel is a front end web developer living in los angeles, california. he would like you to know that this site is the only place that he ever leads with that, but since we're already talking about it, he loves working with javascript (especially in node), though he's no stranger to client side logic. he's also been known to fraternize with HTML & CSS, and has worked both with single page apps and server side javascript. he's comfortable working on static sites, dynamic sites, APIs, databases, and all things in between (and beyond). he has worked with [beachcoders](https://beachcoders.com), [hackreactor](https://www.hackreactor.com), [glo](https://www.glo.com), and [recharge](https://rechargepayments.com/). he is very comfortable in fully distributed, remote teams, though he's also worked within in-office teams.

* here's his [résumé](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N39zsPEzhQh3N3zMEe52Fpbu8aMciZxZnSkjNc9kvk8/edit?usp=sharing).
* here's his [github](https://github.com/AKingDebased) (though his coolest work is all in private repositories. you're better off reading his [posts](/)).

when trying to impress people at parties, he prefers to talk about his [amateur 3d modeling](https://www.thingiverse.com/daddydagon/designs), his growing stable of 3d printers, his deep obsession with [cosplay](https://www.instagram.com/daddydagon/), weightlifting, magic: the gathering, and his ongoing quest to find a way to (legally) die with a sword in his hand, boots on his feet, and a roar in this throat.

you can hit him up at [akingdebased@gmail.com](mailto:akingdebased@gmail.com), or just check out his [contact](/contact) form.
